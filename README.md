# Conflux Protocols: 
Reproducible Opensource Biological Automation Protocols
---
# Vision Statement
Biological automation has the potential to increase the speed at which discovery in the life science space happens and allows for consistent reproducible results across institutions and laboratories. These aid in interoperability between research projects and minimize the rework required to get biological protocols operational.

However, this information is not freely disseminated or available due to a number of factors:

Hardware Fragmentation across commercially available liquid handlers and robotics.
An impetus to keep protocols in house, either to avoid getting 'scooped' in a research context or act as a competitive advantage against other researchers.
A disconnect between the needs of biologists and robotic implementation.

Conflux seeks to fix these issues by acting as an open-source repository for automation protocols and a linuga franca by acting as a translator for different automation platforms.

# Technical Data:
Conflux is intended to be used as an openly-available web application.
